"""Sabotage scorer for hook-store's SetHookEnabled and the enabled filter.

Written by the 201st nightly pass, 2026-08-15, working step 2 of noteboard card
25ac6a72-a5a0-4ada-b4a9-aeeb4e688177 — the sweep of boolean parameters that no
test ever passes both values to.

A test that passes is not a test that works. This script breaks the code the new
tests were written to pin, one edit at a time, and reports whether the suite
noticed. Run it from the repo root:

    python3 scripts/sabotage-set-hook-enabled.py

Exit 0 means every mutation was caught. Exit 3 means at least one survived, and
the survivor is named — a surviving mutation is a hole in the tests, not a
failure of this script.

Two rules are enforced here because earlier passes lost time to both:

  * Every needle must occur EXACTLY ONCE in its file, checked before the write.
    A needle that matches nothing produces a green run indistinguishable from a
    surviving mutation. The 201st pass hit exactly this on its first attempt and
    briefly recorded a false survivor.
  * The unmutated tree must be green first. Scoring a red suite measures nothing.

The MINE column below (`-run` filtered to the new tests) is not attribution on
its own. To ask what the new tests added, move the new test file out of the
package and re-run: that is the PRIOR column, and it is the only one that can
distinguish "these tests catch it" from "something in the package already did".
Comparing a filtered run against the whole package cannot — the package contains
the filter.
